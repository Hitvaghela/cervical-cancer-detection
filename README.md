# cervical-cancer-detection

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting and analyzing cervical cancer using machine learning models. The goal was to develop an efficient pipeline for preprocessing, model training, and evaluation to achieve high accuracy in predicting cervical cancer risks based on given datasets.

## Features
- Implementation of multiple machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, classical model etc.)
- Comprehensive evaluation of models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering for optimal performance
- Achieved significant accuracy improvement compared to baseline methods

## Dataset
- Source : Cervical Cancer Dataset Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ranzeet013/cervical-cancer-dataset)
